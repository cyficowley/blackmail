# Overview

[Blackmailer](https://blackmailer.xyz/) allows users to **blackmail themselves** into completing their goals.

Users provide:
- A **goal** they wish to complete
- How they plan on proving completion
- **Blackmail** of themselves (text or file)
- An **email** of someone they don't want to see the blackmail

If the user does not upload proof of completion by their self made deadline, the **blackmail is automatically sent**.
